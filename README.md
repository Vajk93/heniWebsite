I made this site for a hairdresser friend.

The finished, working site: 
https://schillingheni.hu

The github link:
https://vajk93.github.io/heniWebsite/

I used Figma for design and photoshop to optimizing photos. 

I used html ,css and native js. I met lot's of new problems, but finally, (and slowly) i could solve those.
